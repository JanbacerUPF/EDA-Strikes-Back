            "previous": "You awaken to a faint, indistinguishable voice calling your name, a soft echo in the back of your mind. \"What's your name, traveler?\"",
            "aftername": "You realise that thatâ€™s the only thing you remember, your name. Suddenly, as if it could read your thoughts, the voice, ethereal and soothing, begins to unravel the tragic tale of your world.",
            "prophecy": "\"For centuries,\" it intones, \"a malevolent force has drained the souls of the innocent to achieve eternal life and boundless power. This villain, unable to harness souls like the chosen ones, has fed on the essence of life itself, pushing our world towards extinction. A prophecy foretold a hero, one who would rise to challenge this darkness and restore balance. You are that hero, awakened to fulfill your destiny.\"",
            "last": "Rising from the dusty floor, you find yourself within the dilapidated remains of what was once a thriving farm. Weeds choke the crumbling walls, and the air is thick with abandonment. The voice, now your guiding light, urges you to seek weaponry and prepare for the journey ahead. Exploring the remnants of the farm, you come across an old chest containing both comfortable, light clothing and a suit of heavy steel armor. These items, imbued with the essence of past warriors, will accompany you as you step out into the unknown, driven by a renewed sense of purpose and the silent guidance of the voice."
