You approach the enormous door, which is heavy and creaks. Upon entering, a deep voice from the dark interior pronounces:\n\nWelcome, intrepid traveller, to this sacred place where the whispers of the past dance in the shadows. Here, among the shadows entwined with ethereal light, you will find answers to forgotten questions and truths waiting to be revealed. What do you seek in this place of sepulchral silences and stones aged by history? Do you desire knowledge, or do you seek to redeem the weight of your own uncertainties in the echoes of times past? Before you cross the threshold into the very essence of this temple, you must face the riddles that guard its entrance, three challenges that will test your wit and bravery. Only those worthy of ancient wisdom will unravel the secrets that lie beyond these stone walls. So, traveller, are you prepared to challenge the whispers of the past and face the riddles that await you in this abode of eternity? If so, proceed to the first chamber. By the way, I am the Protector of the Sacred Temple, and I have been guarding it for as long as I can remember. I will not make things easy for you, so beware if you answer a riddle incorrectly. Good luck, adventurer.\n\nYou proceed to the first challenge. In this first chamber, there are three possible paths to continue, each one a response to the riddle. The Protector of the temple appears again:\nHello again, stranger. Here comes your first trial, a simple riddle. As you can see, there are three paths, but only one will lead you to the next level without suffering.\n\nIn the first room of the temple, the protagonist encounters three ancient spirits (Alexander, Bernard, and Cyrus), each playing a different role in the past civilization. One is a guardian of truth who always tells the truth, another is a spirit deceiver who always lies, and the third is a knight who can either lie or tell the truth.\nAlexander says: 'Cyrus is the spirit deceiver'.\nBernard says: 'Alexander is the guardian of the truth'.\nCyrus says: 'I am the knight'.",

The sky, if it can be called that, is a maelstrom of dark colours and shadows. The stolen souls and dreams float around, trapped in ethereal bubbles that reflect their last moments of life and deepest desires.\n\nIn the centre of this chaos stands the villain's fortress, an imposing structure seemingly built from the dreams and nightmares of its victims. The walls are made of a dark, glossy material that appears to absorb light, decorated with reliefs showing scenes of suffering and despair. Twisted towers and spirals rise towards the distorted sky, while the base of the fortress sinks into the abyss, as if rooted in the very heart of darkness. Creatures formed from nightmares roam the abyss, guarding the fortress.",
